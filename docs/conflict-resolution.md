# Conflict Resolution

EntglDb provides **pluggable conflict resolution strategies** to handle concurrent updates to the same document across different nodes. The strategy applies when the sync engine detects that two nodes have independently modified the same document (detected via vector clock divergence).

## Overview

When two nodes modify the same document offline and later sync, a conflict occurs. EntglDb provides two built-in strategies:

1. **Last Write Wins (LWW)** - Simple, timestamp-based resolution
2. **Recursive Merge** - Intelligent JSON merging with array handling

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

### Last Write Wins (LWW)

**How it works:**
- Each document has a Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) timestamp
- During sync, the document with the **highest timestamp wins**
- Conflicts are resolved automatically with no merge attempt

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple and predictable
- ✅ Fast (no merge computation)
- ✅ No data corruption or invalid states

**Cons:**
- ❌ Data loss - one change is discarded entirely
- ❌ Not suitable for collaborative editing

**Use Cases:**
- Configuration data with infrequent updates
- Reference data (product catalogs, price lists)
- Single-user scenarios with backup sync

#### Example

```csharp
// Both nodes start with same document
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }

// Node A updates (timestamp: 100)
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alice", "age": 26 }

// Node B updates (timestamp: 105)
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alicia", "age": 25 }

// After sync: Node B wins (higher timestamp)
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alicia", "age": 25 }
// Node A's age change is LOST
```

### Recursive Merge

**How it works:**
- Performs deep JSON merge of conflicting documents
- Uses the **highest timestamp** for each individual field
- Arrays with `id` or `_id` fields are merged by identity
- Arrays without IDs are concatenated and deduplicated

**Pros:**
- ✅ Preserves changes from both nodes
- ✅ Suitable for collaborative scenarios
- ✅ Intelligent array handling

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex logic
- ❌ Slightly slower (~5-10ms overhead)
- ❌ May produce unexpected results with complex nested structures

**Use Cases:**
- TodoLists, shopping carts (demonstrated in samples)
- Collaborative documents
- Complex objects with independent fields
- Data where every change matters

#### Example: Field-Level Merge

```csharp
// Both nodes start with same document
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }

// Node A updates (timestamp: 100)
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alice", "age": 26 }

// Node B updates (timestamp: 105)  
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alicia", "age": 25 }

// After Recursive Merge:  
{ "id": "doc-1", "name": "Alicia", "age": 26 }
// Uses latest timestamp for each field independently
```

#### Example: Array Merging with IDs

```csharp
// Initial TodoList
{
  "id": "list-1",
  "name": "Shopping",
  "items": [
    { "id": "1", "task": "Buy milk", "completed": false },
    { "id": "2", "task": "Buy bread", "completed": false }
  ]
}

// Node A: Completes milk, adds eggs
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "1", "task": "Buy milk", "completed": true },
    { "id": "2", "task": "Buy bread", "completed": false },
    { "id": "3", "task": "Buy eggs", "completed": false }
  ]
}

// Node B: Completes bread, adds cheese
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "1", "task": "Buy milk", "completed": false },
    { "id": "2", "task": "Buy bread", "completed": true },
    { "id": "4", "task": "Buy cheese", "completed": false }
  ]
}

// After Recursive Merge: ALL changes preserved!
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "1", "task": "Buy milk", "completed": true },   // A's completion
    { "id": "2", "task": "Buy bread", "completed": true }, // B's completion
    { "id": "3", "task": "Buy eggs", "completed": false }, // A's addition
    { "id": "4", "task": "Buy cheese", "completed": false } // B's addition
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Register via Dependency Injection (v2.x)

```csharp
using EntglDb.Core.Sync;

// In Program.cs or Startup.cs — register before AddEntglDbCore()
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConflictResolver, LastWriteWinsConflictResolver>();
// OR
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConflictResolver, RecursiveNodeMergeConflictResolver>();

builder.Services
    .AddEntglDbCore()
    .AddEntglDbBLite<AppDbContext, AppDocumentStore>(
        sp => new AppDbContext("myapp.blite"))
    .AddEntglDbNetwork<StaticPeerNodeConfigurationProvider>();
```

If no `IConflictResolver` is registered, EntglDb defaults to **Last Write Wins**.

### Console Sample

```bash
# Use Recursive Merge
dotnet run --merge

# Use Last Write Wins (default)
dotnet run
```

### UI Samples (Avalonia/MAUI)

Resolver is selectable via UI:
1. Choose "Recursive Merge" or "Last Write Wins" radio button  
2. Click "💾 Save"
3. **Restart the application** for changes to take effect

Settings are persisted in:
- **Avalonia**: `appsettings.json` → `"ConflictResolver": "Merge"`
- **MAUI**: `Preferences` → `"ConflictResolver"`

## Interactive Demo

Both Avalonia and MAUI samples include a **"🔬 Run Conflict Demo"** button that:
1. Creates a TodoList with 2 items
2. Simulates concurrent edits from two "nodes"
3. Shows the merged result
4. Compares LWW vs Recursive Merge behavior

**Try it yourself** to see the difference!

## Best Practices

### Use LWW When:
- Only one user/node typically writes
- Data is reference/configuration
- Simplicity is more important than preserving every change
- Performance is critical

### Use Recursive Merge When:
- Multiple users collaborate
- Every change is valuable (e.g., TodoItems, cart items)
- Data has independent fields that can conflict
- Arrays have `id` fields for identity

### Avoid Conflicts Entirely:
- Use **different collections** for different data types
- Implement **optimistic locking** with version fields
- Design data models to minimize overlapping writes

## Custom Resolvers

You can implement `IConflictResolver` for custom logic:

```csharp
public class CustomResolver : IConflictResolver
{
    public ValueTask<string> ResolveConflict(
        string localJson, 
        string remoteJson, 
        long localTimestamp, 
        long remoteTimestamp)
    {
        // Your custom merge logic here
        return new ValueTask<string>(result);
    }
}
```

Register your resolver:
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IConflictResolver, CustomResolver>();
```

## Performance

Benchmark results (1000 conflict resolutions):

| Strategy | Avg Time | Throughput |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Last Write Wins | 0.05ms | 20,000 ops/sec |
| Recursive Merge | 0.15ms | 6,600 ops/sec |

**Recommendation**: Performance difference is negligible for most applications. Choose based on data preservation needs.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I switch resolvers at runtime?**  
A: No. The resolver is injected at startup. Changing requires application restart.

**Q: What happens if I change resolvers after data exists?**  
A: Existing data is unaffected. Only future conflicts use the new strategy.

**Q: Can different nodes use different resolvers?**  
A: Technically yes, but **not recommended**. All nodes should use the same strategy for consistency.

**Q: Does this handle schema changes?**  
A: No. Conflict resolution assumes both documents have compatible schemas.
